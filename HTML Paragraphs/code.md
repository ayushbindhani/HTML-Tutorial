# HTML Paragraphs
The HTML ```<p>``` element defines a paragraph.

A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

```
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
```

# Output:

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
