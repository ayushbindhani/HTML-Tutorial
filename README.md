# What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content

# Simple Example 
1. The ```<!DOCTYPE html>``` declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
2. The ```<html>``` element is the root element of an HTML page
3. The ```<head>``` element contains meta information about the HTML page
4. The ```<title>``` element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
5. The ```<body>``` element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
6. The ```<h1>``` element defines a large heading
7. The ```<p>``` element defines a paragraph
  
  
```
  
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
  
  ```
Output: 
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
